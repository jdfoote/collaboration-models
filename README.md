# collaboration-models
These models are aimed to investigate the mechanisms that engender the observed gender disparity, and show that explicit gender stereotypes against women, as much as they are prevalent in some tech communities, may not be the only driver for the uneven distribution of men and women in collaborative spaces. An initial experience differential between the two groups could create gender disparity alone, and such differential may be reinforced over time by various other factors.
